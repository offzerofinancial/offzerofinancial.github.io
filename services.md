## Not Financial Advice
According to FINRA's [National Financial Capability Study of 2021](https://finrafoundation.org/sites/finrafoundation/files/NFCS-Investor-Report-Changing-Landscape.pdf), over half of investors under 35 use YouTube (56 percent), and 41 percent use Reddit.

## Plan Summary
To bring [The Plan](/plan.md) into reality, I've broken it up into 3 parts: 
1. Off-Zero Financial, LLC.
1. MyFi.Coach
1. offzero.io

### Off-Zero Financial, LLC. 
The Texas LLC formed to be registered as an Investment Advisor.

### MyFi.Coach
The interactive website Off-Zero Financial, LLC. provides clients to comply with the Internet Investment Advisors exemption for SEC registration under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940.

### offzero.io
The technology company (not yet legally formed) Off-Zero Financial, LLC. uses to implement the interactive website, https://myfi.coach/.

#### The Technology Hypothesis
Generative AI can be used to streamline the process of onboarding new clients by automating the interview process to discover investment goals and risk tolerance. 

New and innovative investment opportunities can be developed by applying Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) onto a common Large Language Model (LLM) and synthesizing domain specific facts into the response.
