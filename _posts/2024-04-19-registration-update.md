**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

Austin, TX â€“ Off-Zero Financial, a renowned financial services firm, announced today its strategic decision to withdraw its registration as an Investment Advisor with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and to pursue state-level registration in Texas. This move aligns with the company's focus on enhancing local operations and services tailored to the Texan market.

The transition from federal to state registration is expected to optimize Off-Zero Financial's agility and responsiveness to regional financial needs and regulations. "This shift will allow us to be more closely connected with our Texas clients," said Kevin Horner, CEO of Off-Zero Financial.

After a recent SEC ruling on Internet Advisors, Off-Zero Financial would be required to deliver advisory services exclusively through their website https://MyFi.coach. State registration allows Off-Zero to deliver services personally to Texas residents.

The firm has initiated the necessary procedures to comply with the Texas State Securities Board regulations and anticipates a smooth transition with minimal impact on clients and stakeholders. Off-Zero Financial remains committed to upholding the highest standards of service and integrity that have defined its reputation in the industry.
